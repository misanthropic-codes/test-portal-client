Due to the extensive scope of this project, I'm creating a comprehensive yet focused implementation. Here's my completion strategy:

## What I'm Building:

### ✅ Core Infrastructure (Complete)
- TypeScript types
- Utility functions
- Custom hooks
- API client

### 🔨 Currently Building:
1. **Mock Services** - For development without backend
2. **Authentication Context** - User session management
3. **Essential UI Components** - Reusable components
4. **Key Pages**:
   - Authentication (Login/Register)
   - Dashboard
   - Test Listing & Details
   - Test Taking Interface (full-featured)
   - Results & Solutions
   
### ⏭️ To Be Added Next:
- Analytics dashboard
- Theme provider
- Additional features (bookmarks, leaderboard)

## Why This Strategy:
1. **Immediate Functionality** - You'll have a working test portal quickly
2. **Backend Independent** - Frontend works with mock data
3. **Easy Integration** - Mock services use same interface as real APIs
4. **Incremental Development** - Can add features progressively

The mock services will generate realistic data so you can demo the application while the backend team implements the APIs.
